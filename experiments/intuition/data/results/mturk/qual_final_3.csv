First, a minor issue, but in the second example listed under ""3D Bar Charts: Volume."" You say there that ""groups 'A' and 'B' have an outcome of only 1 for proposal one while 'C' still has an outcome of 100"", different from the previous chart where all three groups had a value of 100 and proposal one was shown as a cube. But you can clear see from the chart that it is group A that still has a value of 100. Either the text is wrong or the chart is wrong.The 2nd issue I encountered is a bit worse, and that is that frankly the explanation for how the 3D charts handle proportion differences in the groups is very unclear. In 3D-4 I am first given an example of this, and the hint just outright says it's hard to tell from 3D charts alone and I should read the text. Okay, fair enough.But then in 3D-5 and told to ""notice how the sizes of the 3D bars change based on the change in proportion of the groups."" But I'm given no explanation as to how or why. Yes, if I scroll up I can see a difference, but I am left wondering why even.Then in the next section ""3D Bar Charts: Different Sized Groups"" I get an explanation that it's represented by scaling the axes, which I can sort of see from comparing the two charts, but it's not clear how one tells the difference from scaling axes due to different proportions and different outcomes for different groups.Overall I am left with impression that the 3D charts are extremely terrible at representing the data when the groups are different proportions to each other. Maybe that's just a weakness of the charts, but if it's not the case then there is probably an issue either with the explanation or my understanding, or perhaps both.",elephant,B,one,two,A,one,one,A,one,two,B,one,three,2957.344,,

The volume of a 2D shape is going to be zero because it has no depth, right? So, I chose none. It's not like the depth is set to one. There is literally no other axis.I spent a ton of time on the non-question, explanation, of ""3D Bar Charts: Different Sized Groups"" and I'm still not sure if I totally get it.Proposal one has 100*100*1 for the volume, which is 10,000. Proposal two has 1*1*101 for the volume, which is 101. But this is the left-side we're dealing with. On the right, I'm not sure if I get it.I'm looking at ""Question 3D-6"" and see proposal two has an outcome of 1 for all three. But each groups have different sizes, 30, 10, and 20. So why does proposal two, the orange thing, look like a cube and not something distorted? Or is this because of the logarithm scaling?Maybe I'm overlooking something obvious here.
