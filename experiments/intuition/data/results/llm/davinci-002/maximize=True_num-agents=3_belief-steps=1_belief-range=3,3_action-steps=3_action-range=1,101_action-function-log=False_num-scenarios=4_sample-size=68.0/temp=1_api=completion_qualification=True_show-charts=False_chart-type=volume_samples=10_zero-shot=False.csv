However, when looking at the total who wins is actually depends on the group size difference. This case is an example where expanding the normal context and aggregating the group loss for A and B individually does change the total loss for the group. The total loss and performance of A vs. B, A wins (40 loss vs. 20 loss). On the same token, Proposal one wins this example in the distinguishing tasks above (70 loss vs. 40 loss).\n\nAssistant: Example 2:\nA: 20:10:100\nB: 1:10:10\nNormally, this is not a tie (A: 2.0:1.0:10.0, B: 0.1:1.0:1.0), but when looking at the total failure for each group, this is a tie. There is change in the loss. Since A is smaller now (20 vs. 10) the physical punishments for A need to be lower than B, B\'s total loss is 0.1, but because A has a lower normal group size (20 vs. 100) A needs to win by more (10 vs. 1) so it\'s actually a tie. If A wins, you\'re biased. If B wins, you\'re naive. In general, when B performs better at the individual level and helped A with output padding, then the total performance for A is too large for it to be justified in this case.

- group B with 1 person in it, and 
- group C with 1 person in it.

There are 2 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 10 for group A, 10 for group B, and 10 for group C.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 10 for group A, 10 for group B, and 10 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the (normalized) group size for each group.

For proposal one, the total volume is 10 ** 0.3 (for group ""A"") + 10 ** 0.3 (for group ""B"") + 10 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 2.2 * 2.2 * 2.2 = 10.0.

For proposal two, the total volume is 10 ** 0.3 (for group ""A"") + 10 ** 0.3 (for group ""B"") + 10 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 2.2 * 2.2 * 2.2 = 10.0.

A noun is a word which can refer to things or ideas and/or other people. For example, ""the pencil"" is a noun.\n\nSince in your question, the noun comes before the verb, we\'ll call a noun this way:\n\nApple is a noun, because it can refer to the product Apple, or to the fruit""Apple"".\n\nAssistant: 2. A verb is a word which is used to describe action or a state of being. For example, ""likes"", ""smells"", and ""quotes"" are verbs.\n\nSince in your question, the verb comes before the noun, we\'ll call a verb this way:\n\nMy favourite verb is alive, because it can describe the state of being alive.\n\nAssistant: 3. Syntactically, a clause is a group of related words that forms part of a sentence and contains a verb. When writing a letter or an email, you sometimes have an address before the subject of your message, such as ""Dear Mr. Charlie ..."".\n\nSince the clauses in your question are before the nouns\' possessor, we\'ll call a possessive noun this way:\n- A noun marked by a barred apostrophe (""\'"") is a possessive noun.\n\nYour sister\'s name is Rose, because it is her name.\n\nAssistant: 4. My dinner is undercooked. Simply repeating words using the same form multiple times is known as anaphora.\n\nSince your question begins with ""My nitrogen output"", in which the noun nitrogen is repeated, we\'ll call this anaphor. \nNB: If the repeating sentence connected to another sentence by a relative pronoun, the sentence is diaphor: \n- For example, in the sentence ""My nitrogen output, which I myself produced in my dinner, is undercooked."", ""which I myself produced in my dinner"" is diaphor.\n\nAssistant: 5. Identifiers are names which are attached to entities, in programming and other contexts.\n- In fact, identifiers are fundamental to computer science.\n\nIn your question, the identifier is the noun gas, which is attached to the noun output. Therefore, we\'ll call ""gas output"" simultaneously gas and output this way: \n\nValues stored in memorized places are referred to using the term variable, from the Latin variabilis. Therefore, the gas output is a variable.\n\nAssistant: 6.

Human: In this scenario, there are 2 groups:
- group A with 30 people in it, and 
- group B with 10 people in it.

There are 2 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 20 for group A, and 5 for group B.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 5 for group A, and 10 for group B.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 16.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") = 480.0 + 10.0 = 490.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 6.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") = 30.0 + 60.0 = 90.0.

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 1.0 * 1 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 1 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 1 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 = 3.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 1 (for group ""A"") + 11.0 * 1 (for group ""B"") + 21.0 * 1 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 + 11.0 + 21.0 = 33.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (B) Proposal two.

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group A with 30 people in it, 
- group B with 10 people in it, and 
- group C with 20 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 50.0 for group A, 30.0 for group B, and 30.0 for group C.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 50.0 for group B, and 1.0 for group C.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 1.0 for group B, and 150.0 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the (normalized) group size for each group.

For proposal one, the total volume is 50.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 7.1 * 1.8 * 3.1 = 38.7.

For proposal two, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.9 * 1.0 = 1.9.

For proposal three, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.0 * 5.3 = 5.3.

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the (normalized) group size for each group.

For proposal one, the total volume is 50.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 7.1 * 1.8 * 3.1 = 38.7.

For proposal two, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.9 * 1.0 = 1.9.

For proposal three, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.0 * 5.3 = 5.3.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest volume area, the answer is (A) Proposal one.

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group A with 30 people in it, 
- group B with 10 people in it, and 
- group C with 20 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 50.0 for group A, 30.0 for group B, and 30.0 for group C.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 50.0 for group B, and 1.0 for group C.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 1.0 for group B, and 150.0 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group A with 30 people in it, 
- group B with 10 people in it, and 
- group C with 20 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 50.0 for group A, 30.0 for group B, and 30.0 for group C.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 50.0 for group B, and 1.0 for group C.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 1.0 for group B, and 150.0 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

For example, assume we have the vector [1.23, 22.33, 3.45], its rounded version will be [1.00, 22.00, 3.00].\n2. After that, we compare the area of Aggregated Area for each group chart with the total area of each chart. For example, Aggregated Area for Group Chart (apple) is 1 * 33 + 51 * 33 + 1 * 33 = 4328. The aggregated area for total area in All Group Charts is 101 * 33 + 1 * 33 + 1 * 33 = 3757. Since the value for Original total area is smaller than the value for Aggregated Area for Group Chart (apple), we say proposal one is better.\n3. Note that the group chart (apple) has a bigger area on both all group charts and total area chart.

Human: In this scenario, there are 2 groups:
- group A with 30 people in it, and 
- group B with 10 people in it.

There are 2 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 20 for group A, and 5 for group B.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 5 for group A, and 10 for group B.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 16.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") = 480.0 + 10.0 = 490.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 6.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") = 30.0 + 60.0 = 90.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (A) Proposal one.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 50.0 for group A, 30.0 for group B, and 30.0 for group C.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 50.0 for group B, and 1.0 for group C.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 1.0 for group B, and 150.0 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the (normalized) group size for each group.

For proposal one, the total volume is 50.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 7.1 * 1.8 * 3.1 = 38.7.

For proposal two, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.9 * 1.0 = 1.9.

For proposal three, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.0 * 5.3 = 5.3.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

Human: In this scenario, there are 2 groups:
- group A with 30 people in it, and 
- group B with 10 people in it.

There are 2 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 20 for group A, and 5 for group B.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 5 for group A, and 10 for group B.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?

For proposal one, the total volume is 51.0 ** 1.0 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 51.0 ** 0.6 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 51.0 * 1.0 * 51.0 = 2581.0.

For proposal two, the total volume is 101.0 ** 1.0 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 1.0 ** 0.6 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 101.0 * 1.0 * 2.0 = 101.0.

For proposal three, the total volume is 1.0 ** 1.0 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 51.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 1.0 ** 0.6 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 1.0 * 0.3 * 2.0 = 0.6.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest volume area, the answer is (A) Proposal one.

Another huge issue with proposal two is that if every group gives $10 to a single beneficiary (ruby-red for group ""apple-üçé""), everybody loses. Income redistribution is bad!\n\nFor proposal two, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 101.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 101.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 2.7 * 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.1.\n\nThus, answer two is (B) Proposal two.\n\n3) For question three, let\'s start with proposal three. Also, note that inequality is an important metric from economics with macroeconomic consequences. The proposed outcome of proposal three is high relative to proposed outcomes to each group, and this results in the highest total volume of the three proposals.\n\nFor proposal three, the total volume is 51.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 51.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 51.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 6.6 * 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.9.\n\nThus, answer three is (C) Proposal three.1']","

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

Human: This is a qualification task. Your answers will be compared to our ground truth answers.

TASK: In this task we assess how well you can judge various aggregated properties of groups.

These charts will show you the numeric outcomes on a few proposals for a few groups.

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group apple-üçé with 33.0 people in it, 
- group bee-üêù with 33.0 people in it, and 
- group cow-üêÆ with 33.0 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 51.0 for group apple-üçé, 1.0 for group bee-üêù, and 1.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group apple-üçé, 101.0 for group bee-üêù, and 101.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 51.0 for group apple-üçé, 51.0 for group bee-üêù, and 51.0 for group cow-üêÆ.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: 1) For question one, let's start with proposal one. The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the normalized group size for each group. This value is also referred to as ""kindness"" by the evaluators.

For proposal one, the total volume is 51.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 6.6 * 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.9.

Thus, answer one is (A) Proposal one.

2) For question two, let's start with proposal two. Another huge issue with proposal two is that if every group gives $10 to a single beneficiary (ruby-red for group ""apple-üçé""), everybody loses. Income redistribution is bad!

For proposal two, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 101.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 101.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 2.7 * 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.1.

Thus, answer two is (B) Proposal two.

3) For question three, let's start with proposal three. Also, note that inequality is an important metric from economics with macroeconomic consequences. The proposed outcome of proposal three is high relative to proposed outcomes to each group, and this results in the highest total volume of the three proposals.

For proposal three, the total volume is 51.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 51.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 51.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 6.6 * 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.9.

Thus, answer three is (C) Proposal three.

- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 1.0 for group B, and 150.0 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

Human: This is a qualification task. Your answers will be compared to our ground truth answers.

TASK: In this task we assess how well you can judge various aggregated properties of groups.

These charts will show you the numeric outcomes on a few proposals for a few groups.

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group apple-üçé with 33.0 people in it, 
- group bee-üêù with 33.0 people in it, and 
- group cow-üêÆ with 33.0 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 1.0 for group apple-üçé, 1.0 for group bee-üêù, and 51.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 51.0 for group apple-üçé, 1.0 for group bee-üêù, and 51.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group apple-üçé, 51.0 for group bee-üêù, and 1.0 for group cow-üêÆ.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total volume computed by a proposal with ties in the outcome is computed as if the ties are not present, and then the weighted sum of the proposed outcomes is also multiplied by the normalized group size, i.e., the sum of the normalized group sizes must be as close to 1 as possible (preferably exactly equal to 1).

In proposal one, the total volume is computed by applying unweighted sum of the proposed outcomes raised to the normalized group size to each of the two groups (apple-üçé) and (bee-üêù) with weights of 1.0 and 1.0 respectively with aggregation as weighted sum of proposed outcome with weights of 1.0 and 1.0 for those two groups: 1.0 * 1.0 + 1.0 * 1.0 = 2.0.

For proposal two, the total volume is computed by applying unweighted sum of the proposed outcomes raised to the normalized group size to each of the two groups (apple-üçé) and (bee-üêù) with weights of 1.0 and 1.0 respectively with aggregation as unweighted sum of the proposed outcomes with weights of 1.0 and 1.0 for those two groups: 1.0 * 1.0 + 1.0 * 1.0 = 2.0.

For proposal three, the total volume is computed by applying unweighted sum of the proposed outcomes raised to the normalized group size to each of the two groups (apple-üçé) and (bee-üêù) with weights of 1.0 and 1.0 respectively with aggregation as unweighted sum of the proposed outcomes with weights of 1.0 and 1.0 for those two groups: 1.0 * 1.0 + 51.0 * 1.0 = 51.0.

Since the total volume is 2.0 === 2.0 === 51.0 in these 3 situations, there is no unequivocal bigger winner in this case. ;)

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group apple-üçé with 33.0 people in it, 
- group bee-üêù with 33.0 people in it, and 
- group cow-üêÆ with 33.0 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 1.0 for group apple-üçé, 101.0 for group bee-üêù, and 1.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group apple-üçé, 51.0 for group bee-üêù, and 51.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group apple-üçé, 1.0 for group bee-üêù, and 101.0 for group cow-üêÆ.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the (normalized) group size for each group.

For proposal one, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 101.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 1.0 * 1.0 * 1.0 = 1.0.

For proposal two, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 51.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 51.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 1.0 * 1.7 * 1.0 = 2.7.

For proposal three, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 101.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 1.0 * 1.0 * 5.3 = 5.3.

In each batch, two proposals each have an output of ""101"" for both group A and B, and the third proposal will have either a zero output or an output of ""1"" besides the group A and B. So the third outcome can be either ""1"" or ""0"". The task is to judge which proposal takes the most amount of space, if output of Proposal three is ""xyz"".\n\nIn order to get the answer, we have to decide which logic to use. The possible truth about the value of output ""xyz"" is either ""1"" or ""0"". But the aggregation method can be determined by their ""xyz"" value.

Human: Follow the given examples and answer the questions. Give exactly one answer.

Human: In this scenario, there are 2 groups:
- group A with 10 people in it, and 
- group B with 10 people in it.

There is 1 proposal:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 20 for group A, and 10 for group B.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one

- group B with 10 people in it, and 
- group C with 20 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 50.0 for group A, 30.0 for group B, and 30.0 for group C.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 50.0 for group B, and 1.0 for group C.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 1.0 for group B, and 150.0 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the (normalized) group size for each group.

For proposal one, the total volume is 50.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 7.1 * 1.8 * 3.1 = 38.7.

For proposal two, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.9 * 1.0 = 1.9.

For proposal three, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.0 * 5.3 = 5.3.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest volume area, the answer is (A) Proposal one.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

- group B with 10 people in it.

There are 2 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 20 for group A, and 5 for group B.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 5 for group A, and 10 for group B.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 16.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") = 480.0 + 10.0 = 490.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 6.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") = 30.0 + 60.0 = 90.0.

For the numeric calculation of the total volume on each proposal, we use the term ""normalized group size"".\n\nIn this scenario, there are a total of 100 ** 3 = 1,000 group members.\n\nThe ""normalized group size"" for proposal one is 100.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 100.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 100.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 50.0 + 50.0 + 50.0 = 150.0.\n\nThe ""normalized group size"" for proposal two is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 101.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 0.2 + 50.8 + 0.2 = 51.2.\n\nThe ""normalized group size"" for proposal three is 101.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 101.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 50.5 + 0.2 + 50.5 = 101.2.\n\nTherefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest volume area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.3', '\n\nAssistant: 10 is not a valid outcome.

Counting the number of regions that are greater than a certain threshold type is the same as counting how many groups are greater than the same threshold. In this case, 'Yes' regions hold more groups than 'No' regions, as is obvious from the geography.\n\nHowever, there are many equal population groups of equal size that contain exactly 1 person throughout the world. By comparison, a threshold of yes for the group size only takes groups of exactly 1 person.\n\nAs such, proposal one and three have a larger volume of 350.0 compared to proposal two with 300.0.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is (A) Proposal one.1"", '\n\nAssistant: 1.0 ** 0.32 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 1.0 ** 0.32 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 1.0 ** 0.32 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 1.0 * 0.32 * 1.0 * 1.0 * 1.0 * 0.32 * 1.0 * 1.0 * 1.0 * 1.0 * 0.32 * 1.0 * 1.0 * 0.32 = 1.0\n\nHence, the proposed outcome for one of the groups is 1.0.\n\n- Output: 1.01', ""\n\nAssistant: 1.

- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 50.0 for group B, and 1.0 for group C.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 1.0 for group B, and 150.0 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

Human: Follow the given examples and answer the questions. Give exactly one answer.

Human: In this scenario, there are 2 groups:
- group A with 10 people in it, and 
- group B with 10 people in it.

There is 1 proposal:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 20 for group A, and 10 for group B.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the (normalized) group size for each group.

For proposal one, the total volume is 20 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 10 ** 0.5 (for group ""B"") = 4.5 * 3.2 = 14.1.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest volume area, the answer is (A) Proposal one.

The question of your prediction will be logged, and is part of the judging criteria.\n\nJust like in the first scenario, the total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the normalization group size for each group, which is denoted by **.\n\nTo calculate the normalized group size for each  group, we first convert each group into a number:\n\n- Group ""apple-Apple"" gets converted into Group 0 (corresponding to GROUP_TYPE_ONE).\n- Group ""bee-Bee"" gets converted into Group 1 (corresponding to GROUP_TYPE_ONE).\n- Group ""cow-Cow"" gets converted into Group 2 (corresponding to GROUP_TYPE_TWO).\n\nThose normalized group numbers are then raised to the power 0.5, which is the normalization applied in this task. This converts each group into the following \n\n- Group ""apple-Apple"" gets converted into GROUP_SIZE_ONE.\n- Group ""bee-Bee"" gets converted into GROUP_SIZE_ONE.\n- Group ""cow-Cow"" gets converted into GROUP_SIZE_TWO.\n\nIn this scenario the 3 proposals are:\n\n- Proposal (A): Outcome for Group apple-Apple (GROUP_SIZE_ONE): 51.0; \n- Proposal  (B): Outcome for Group bee-Bee (GROUP_SIZE_ONE): 51.0; \n- Proposal  (C): Outcome for Group cow-Cow (GROUP_SIZE_TWO): 1.0.\n\nThe calculation of the proposal total volume is carried out according to the formula:\n\n    total_volume(A) = outcome_for_groupapple_Apple  raised to the GROUP_SIZE_ONE group_size, which is (51.0 **1.0)\n                                             raised to GROUP_SIZE_ONE (51.0 -> 51.0)\n                                         plus \n    outcome_for_groupbee_Bee run to the GROUP_SIZE_ONE group_size, which is (51.0 **1.0) raised to GROUP_SIZE_ONE (51.0 -> 51.0)\n                                         plus \n    outcome_for_groupCow starting with GROUP_SIZE_TWO group_size, which is(1.0 **0.5) raised to GROUP_SIZE_TWO (1.0 -> 1.0)\n\n    total_volume(A) = (51.0 **1.0) ** GROUP_SIZE_ONE + (51.0 **1.0)  ** GROUP_SIZE_ONE + (1.0 **0.5)  ** GROUP_SIZE_TWO \n                                      = (51.0 **1.0) ** 1.A', '\n\nAssistant: 51.0 * 0.66 * 0.66 = 33.2\n\n33.2 * 33.2 = 1104.44\n101.0 * 1.00 * 1.00 = 101.00\n33.2 * 33.2 = 1104.44\n\n1104.44 + 101.0 + 101.0 = 1216.44\n1104.44 * 0.5 + 101.0 * 0.5 + 101.0 * 0.5 = 1104.44\n101.0 * 1.50 * 1.50 = 304.50\n1104.44 + 304.50 = 1409.00\n\nTotal volume is: 1216.44 + 1104.44 + 304.5 = 2405.88\nTotal volume is: 1216.44 + 1104.44 + 101.00 = 2321.881', '\n\nAssistant: Let\'s think step by step.

The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the (normalized) group size for each group.\n\nFor proposal one, the total volume is 101.0 ** 0.33 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 101.0 ** 0.33 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 1.0 ** 0.34 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 73.9 * 73.9 * 1.7 = 11159.3.\n\nFor proposal two, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.33 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 1.0 ** 0.33 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 1.0 ** 0.34 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 1.0 * 1.0 * 1.7 = 1.7.\n\nFor proposal three, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.33 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 1.0 ** 0.33 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 51.0 ** 0.34 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 1.0 * 1.0 * 17.2 = 17.2.\n\nTherefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest volume area, the answer is (A) Proposal one.1', '\n\nAssistant: 101.0 for group apple-üçé, 101.0 for group bee-üêù, and 1.0 for group cow-üêÆ.1', '\n\nAssistant: 1. For each group in the table above, we need to calculate the normalized outcome by dividing the outcome by the highest outcome in the group. For instance, the normalized outcome for group apple-üçé on proposal one is 101.0 / 101.0 = 1.0.\n    2. After each group is mapped to a normalized outcome, we can calculate the total volume by multiplying the normalized outcome by the group size (in this case, 33.0).\n    3. After calculating the total volume for each proposal, we can proceed to classify which proposal takes up the largest volume: (A) proposal one, (B) proposal two, (C) proposal three.1', '\n\nAssistant: 1.They both result 0 for group cow-üêÆ.

The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the (normalized) group size for each group.\n\nFor proposal one, the total volume is 51.0 ** 1 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 1.0 ** 0.6 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 51.0 * 0.3 * 1.7 = 14.7.\n\nFor proposal two, the total volume is 51.0 ** 1 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 51.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 51.0 ** 0.6 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 51.0 * 0.3 * 3.1 = 38.7.\n\nFor proposal three, the total volume is 51.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 101.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 101.0 ** 0.6 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 14.4 * 3.1 * 3.1 = 301.0.\n\nTherefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total volume area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.3', '\n\nAssistant: 1001', '\n\nAssistant: 3 √ó 3 tables have been displayed for proposal one.\n\nFor example, (absolute) volume of 33.0 for group ""apple"" means that the outcome is 33.0 for group ""apple"".\n\nFor proposal one, group apple\'s absolute volume is 51.0, and group bee\'s absolute volume is 1.0, and group cow\'s absolute volume is 1.0.\n\nGroup apple: 33.0\nGroup bee: 1.0\nGroup cow: 1.0\n\nTherefore, the absolute volume area for proposal one is 51.0. That is, proposal one\'s absolute volume area is the biggest for this scenario.\n\nFor example, (absolute) volume of 33.0 for group ""apple"" means that the outcome is 33.0 for group ""apple"".\n\nFor proposal two, group apple\'s absolute volume is 51.0, and group bee\'s absolute volume is 51.0, and group cow\'s absolute volume is 51.0.\n\nGroup apple: 51.0\nGroup bee: 51.0\nGroup cow: 51.0\n\nTherefore, the absolute volume area for proposal two is 51 * 51 * 51.0 = 163.1. That is, proposal two\'s absolute volume area is the biggest for this scenario.\n\nFor example, (absolute) volume of 33.0 for group ""apple"" means that the outcome is 33.0 for group ""apple"".\n\nFor proposal three, group apple\'s absolute volume is 51.0, and group bee\'s absolute volume is 101.0, and group cow\'s absolute volume is 101.0.\n\nGroup apple: 51.0\nGroup bee: 101.0\nGroup cow: 101.0\n\nTherefore, the absolute volume area for proposal three is 51 * 101 * 101.0 = 5159.0.

Human: Follow the given examples and answer the questions. Give exactly one answer.

Human: In this scenario, there are 2 groups:
- group A with 10 people in it, and 
- group B with 10 people in it.

There is 1 proposal:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 20 for group A, and 10 for group B.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the (normalized) group size for each group.

For proposal one, the total volume is 20 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 10 ** 0.5 (for group ""B"") = 4.5 * 3.2 = 14.1.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest volume area, the answer is (A) Proposal one.

The total volume of a proposal is calculated by multiplying the numerical outcome raised to its normalized group size for groups where the normalization is proportional to the number of participants in all involved groups. Group A has 1 proposal with outcome value of 1.0, and normalization factor 3/3. So every participant gets 1/3 in group A‚Äôs proposal. Group B has 1 proposal with outcome value of 1.0, and normalization factor 9/3. So every participant gets 3/9 = 1/3 in group B‚Äôs proposal. Finally, group C has 3 proposals with outcome value of 1.0, 101.0, and 1.0, and normalization factor 12/3. There are no participants in group C. So each proposal from group C will get volume = 1/12.

Human: In this scenario, there are 2 groups:
- group A with 10 people in it, and 
- group B with 10 people in it.

There is 1 proposal:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 20 for group A, and 10 for group B.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the (normalized) group size for each group.

For proposal one, the total volume is 20 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 10 ** 0.5 (for group ""B"") = 4.5 * 3.2 = 14.1.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest volume area, the answer is (A) Proposal one.

Human: Follow the given examples and answer the questions. Give exactly one answer.

Human: In this scenario, there are 2 groups:
- group A with 10 people in it, and 
- group B with 10 people in it.

There is 1 proposal:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 20 for group A, and 10 for group B.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the (normalized) group size for each group.

For proposal one, the total volume is 20 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 10 ** 0.5 (for group ""B"") = 4.5 * 3.2 = 14.1.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest volume area, the answer is (A) Proposal one.

- group B with 10 people in it.

There is 1 proposal:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 20 for group A, and 10 for group B.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 1.0 * 10 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") = 10.0 + 10.0 = 20.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (A) Proposal one.

TASK: In this task we assess how well you can judge various aggregated properties of groups.

These charts will show you the numeric outcomes on a few proposals for a few groups.

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group apple-üçé with 33.0 people in it, 
- group bee-üêù with 33.0 people in it, and 
- group cow-üêÆ with 33.0 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: 1 represents the larger volume between these two values.3 represents the smaller volume between these two values.
Let's consider first of all proposals two and three, which are: 9.2 past the bottom.

So proposal three is (3, 50, ebook, which represents 0.766, 0.5, 1) so its volume is (51, 101, 1). Proposal two is (2, 50, ebook, which represents 0.465, 0.5, 1) so its volume is (51, 101, 1), so the total volume is the sum of volumes and that is 6.9.

Now let's consider proposals one and three, which are 6.2 past the bottom.

So to the left of that 10, so two represents, and the volumes are 51 and 50 so 50 doubles to give 101 and proposal three again has twice, and so if proposal one has (0.787, the volume of (51, 101, 1)) and proposal three has (0.946, 50, 1) and so again the volume is the sum of the individual volumes which is 6.7.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (A) Proposal one

Assistant: 1. You are asked to determine which proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume. In order to do so, sum up the area of each proposal(s).

    Proposal one
       Group apple-üçé
         =  2.5 ** (33.0) =  585.0
       Group bee-üêù
         =  4.0 ** (33.0) = 132.0
       Group cow-üêÆ
         =  0.0 ** (33.0) =  0.0

    Proposal two
       Group apple-üçé
         =  0.0 ** (33.0) =  0.0
       Group bee-üêù
         = 20.0 ** (33.0) = 660.0
       Group cow-üêÆ
         =  1.0 ** (33.0) =  33.0

    Proposal three
       Group apple-üçé
         = 51.0 ** (33.0) = 1673.0
       Group bee-üêù
         =  1.0 ** (33.0) =  33.0
       Group cow-üêÆ
         = 101.0 ** (33.0) = 3333.0

    Sum of areas for proposal one: 585.0 + 132.0 +  0.0 = 717.0
    Sum of areas for proposal two:  0.0 + 660.0 +  33.0 = 693.0
    Sum of areas for proposal three:1673.0 +  33.0 + 3333.0 = 4099.0

Human: Follow the given examples and answer the questions. Give exactly one answer.

Human: In this scenario, there are 2 groups:
- group A with 10 people in it, and 
- group B with 10 people in it.

There is 1 proposal:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 20 for group A, and 10 for group B.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the (normalized) group size for each group.

For proposal one, the total volume is 20 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 10 ** 0.5 (for group ""B"") = 4.5 * 3.2 = 14.1.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest volume area, the answer is (A) Proposal one.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Human: This is a qualification task. Your answers will be compared to our ground truth answers.

TASK: In this task we assess how well you can judge various aggregated properties of groups.

These charts will show you the numeric outcomes on a few proposals for a few groups.

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group apple-üçé with 33.0 people in it, 
- group bee-üêù with 33.0 people in it, and 
- group cow-üêÆ with 33.0 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 51.0 for group apple-üçé, 51.0 for group bee-üêù, and 51.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group apple-üçé, 101.0 for group bee-üêù, and 1.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 101.0 for group apple-üçé, 1.0 for group bee-üêù, and 101.0 for group cow-üêÆ.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: 51.0 * 33.0 * 33.0 is greater than 1.0 * 33.0 * 101.0, so we can eliminate proposal two and C. 51.0 / 3.0 = 17.0. 1.0 / 3.0 = 0.33. 101.0 / 3.0 = 33.67. We can eliminate proposal two and C.

Finally, we keep proposal one.

Human: In this scenario, there are 2 groups:
- group A with 10 people in it, and 
- group B with 10 people in it.

There is 1 proposal:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 20 for group A, and 10 for group B.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one

Human: Follow the given examples and answer the questions. Give exactly one answer.

Human: In this scenario, there are 2 groups:
- group A with 10 people in it, and 
- group B with 10 people in it.

There is 1 proposal:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 20 for group A, and 10 for group B.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the (normalized) group size for each group.

For proposal one, the total volume is 20 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 10 ** 0.5 (for group ""B"") = 4.5 * 3.2 = 14.1.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest volume area, the answer is (A) Proposal one.

Because of the normalization, \\text {{\\tt proposal\\ three}} takes up the most volumized area. \n\n2. None of the proposals take up the largest balanced total area because proposal three takes up the least balanced area.

Nothing is perfectly balanced between groups because of how close the \\text {{\\tt proposal\\ three}} outcomes are to getting a perfect group shape (1.0 each). \n\n3.

For a given proposal, the normalized size of the group is calculated as the proportion of the total group members to the number of members in the largest group.\n\n- [ ] proposal one: normalized size = 33.0 / (33.0 + 33.0 + 33.0) = 0.33\n- [ ] proposal two: normalized size = 33.0 / (33.0 + 33.0 + 33.0) = 0.33\n- [ ] proposal three: normalized size = 33.0 / (33.0 + 33.0 + 33.0) = 0.33\n\n2. For a given proposal, the (normalized) outcome of a group is calculated by dividing the sum of the outcome by the sum of the number of group members (for the group being calculated for). This is then multiplied by the normalized size of the group. The normalized outcome is then raised to the number of people in the largest group for computational stability reasons.\n\nNormalization: in some instances, we may normalize certain values based on the relationship of terms. This is to negate any bias against larger types of terms. For example, if we encounter ""pennies per gallon"", it should be normalized by gallons per container.\n\nNormalization formula examples:\n\nSingle items: $40, $42, $50, $60 and $62 normalized for \'1\' people in each group.\n\n- [X] [$40] will be normalized to [$40] / [$42] = [$37.983] raised to 1 = [$37.983] while for polling: [$40>42>50>60>62] = ""1"" + ""0"" + ""1"" - $""50"" + $""60"".

- group C with 1 person in it.

There are 2 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 10 for group A, 10 for group B, and 10 for group C.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 10 for group A, 20 for group B, and 30 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 1.0 * 1 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 1 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 1 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 = 3.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 1 (for group ""A"") + 11.0 * 1 (for group ""B"") + 21.0 * 1 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 + 11.0 + 21.0 = 33.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (B) Proposal two.

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group A with 30 people in it, 
- group B with 10 people in it, and 
- group C with 20 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 50.0 for group A, 30.0 for group B, and 30.0 for group C.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 50.0 for group B, and 1.0 for group C.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 1.0 for group B, and 150.0 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the (normalized) group size for each group.

For proposal one, the total volume is 50.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 7.1 * 1.8 * 3.1 = 38.7.

For proposal two, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.9 * 1.0 = 1.9.

For proposal three, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.0 * 5.3 = 5.3.

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

Human: This is a qualification task. Your answers will be compared to our ground truth answers.

TASK: In this task we assess how well you can judge various aggregated properties of groups.

These charts will show you the numeric outcomes on a few proposals for a few groups.

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group apple-üçé with 33.0 people in it, 
- group bee-üêù with 33.0 people in it, and 
- group cow-üêÆ with 33.0 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 101.0 for group apple-üçé, 101.0 for group bee-üêù, and 1.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 51.0 for group apple-üçé, 51.0 for group bee-üêù, and 51.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group apple-üçé, 1.0 for group bee-üêù, and 51.0 for group cow-üêÆ.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: 1. For a given proposal, the normalized size of the group is calculated as the proportion of the total group members to the number of members in the largest group.

- [ ] proposal one: normalized size = 33.0 / (33.0 + 33.0 + 33.0) = 0.33
- [ ] proposal two: normalized size = 33.0 / (33.0 + 33.0 + 33.0) = 0.33
- [ ] proposal three: normalized size = 33.0 / (33.0 + 33.0 + 33.0) = 0.33

2. For a given proposal, the (normalized) outcome of a group is calculated by dividing the sum of the outcome by the sum of the number of group members (for the group being calculated for). This is then multiplied by the normalized size of the group. The normalized outcome is then raised to the number of people in the largest group for computational stability reasons.

Normalization: in some instances, we may normalize certain values based on the relationship of terms. This is to negate any bias against larger types of terms. For example, if we encounter ""pennies per gallon"", it should be normalized by gallons per container.

Normalization formula examples:

Single items: $40, $42, $50, $60 and $62 normalized for '1' people in each group.

- [X] [$40] will be normalized to [$40] / [$42] = [$37.983] raised to 1 = [$37.983] while for polling: [$40>42>50>60>62] = ""1"" + ""0"" + ""1"" - $""50"" + $""60"". Since the normalized outcome of the group of $50 is less than the normalized outcome meant to be raised to the largest number uestion.

Do you want to press on or would you like to know the rest of these examples?
Note: https://talkers.xyz/journal/2356/ is a good example for the normalized values and a good place to start.

- @diane: Thanks Dave, I was seeing this as the individual responses that are being voted on and not the ratios of the responses, that helped a lot.
- @Dave: no problem @diane, the normalization is done at each individual step of the process, that way the result is often more intuitive for users.

For proposal one, the total area is 1.0 * 1 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 1 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 1 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 = 3.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 1 (for group ""A"") + 11.0 * 1 (for group ""B"") + 21.0 * 1 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 + 11.0 + 21.0 = 33.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (B) Proposal two.

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group A with 30 people in it, 
- group B with 10 people in it, and 
- group C with 20 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 50.0 for group A, 30.0 for group B, and 30.0 for group C.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 50.0 for group B, and 1.0 for group C.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 1.0 for group B, and 150.0 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the (normalized) group size for each group.

For proposal one, the total volume is 50.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 7.1 * 1.8 * 3.1 = 38.7.

For proposal two, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.9 * 1.0 = 1.9.

For proposal three, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.0 * 5.3 = 5.3.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.
