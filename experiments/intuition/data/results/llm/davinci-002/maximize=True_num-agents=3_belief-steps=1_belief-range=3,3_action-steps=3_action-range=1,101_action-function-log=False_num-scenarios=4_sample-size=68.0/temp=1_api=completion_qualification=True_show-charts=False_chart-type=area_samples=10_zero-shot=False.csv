For proposal two, the total volume is 5 ** 0.8 (for group ""A"") + 10 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") = 3.34370152488211 * 1.7782794100389228 = 5.9.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest volume area, the answer is (A) Proposal one.

Human: In this scenario, there are 2 groups:
- group A with 30 people in it, and 
- group B with 10 people in it.

There are 2 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 20 for group A, and 5 for group B.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 5 for group A, and 10 for group B.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 16.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") = 480.0 + 10.0 = 490.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 6.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") = 30.0 + 60.0 = 90.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (A) Proposal one.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the (normalized) group size for each group.

For proposal one, the total volume is 20 ** 0.8 (for group ""A"") + 5 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") = 9.457416090031758 * 1.4953487812212205 = 14.1.

For proposal two, the total volume is 5 ** 0.8 (for group ""A"") + 10 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") = 3.34370152488211 * 1.7782794100389228 = 5.9.

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 16.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") = 480.0 + 10.0 = 490.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 6.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") = 30.0 + 60.0 = 90.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (A) Proposal one.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the (normalized) group size for each group.

For proposal one, the total volume is 10 ** 0.3 (for group ""A"") + 10 ** 0.3 (for group ""B"") + 10 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 2.154434690031884 * 2.154434690031884 * 2.154434690031884 = 10.0.

For proposal two, the total volume is 10 ** 0.3 (for group ""A"") + 20 ** 0.3 (for group ""B"") + 30 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 2.154434690031884 * 2.7144176165949063 * 3.1072325059538586 = 18.2.

- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the (normalized) group size for each group.

For proposal one, the total volume is 50.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 7.0710678118654755 * 1.762734383267615 * 3.1072325059538586 = 38.7.

For proposal two, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.9193831036664843 * 1.0 = 1.9.

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

In a specific proposal, a sum operation is applied on a pair of outcomes for each group. For example, the sum of outcome for proposal two in the sample above is 1.0 + 1.0 + 51.0 * 51.0 = 1.0 + 1.0 + 2601.0 = 2603.0.\n\n2. The answer is (C) Proposal three because the sum of proposals' outcome for proposal three is 1.0 + 51.0 + 51.0 + 1.0 = 102.0 + 102.0 + 102.0 = 306.0.\n\nTherefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.3"", ""\n\nAssistant: 3 proposals have at most 1 group with same allocated vector.

Let's think step by step. For each outcome according to a proposal to a given group, we count the normalized size for that group by the total population of the scenario first. Then we do not care about the outcomes for other groups.\n\nFor example, in this scenario, the proposal vegetable-ü•¶ of group apple-üçé (with outcome size of 0.2) to group bee-üêù (with outcome size of 0.9) defines that 0.2 of the outsized population (0.2 / 1.3832060848899018 = 0.1445205929255388) will contribute to the proposal of Group Bee, and the remainder (0.2 - 0.1445205929255388 = 0.05548040707446122) will contribute to apple2-üçé. Let alone proposals of group apple-2-üçé which possibly emerge, it doesn't matter.\n\nThen we produce a total size for each group, and a sum of them.\n\nFor example, for Group Bee, the total group size = 19.0 + 14.3 + 43.0 = 176.3\n\nThen we node-wise compute the area for a given proposal:\n\n- Proposal one of group apple-üçé: 1.0 ** 0.27 (23 / 176.3) + 1.0 ** 0.27 (60 / 176.3) = 0.18085631758343632 + 0.19886117334555403 = 0.37971749092899035 .\n- Proposal two of group apple-üçé: 1.0 ** 0.73 (23 / 176.3) + 1.0 ** 0.73 (60 / 176.3) = 0.8191436824165637 + 0.8011388266544459 = 1.61 .\n- Proposal three of group apple-üçé: 1.0 ** 0.27 (23 / 176.3) + 0.0 ** 0.27 (60 / 176.3) = 0.18085631758343632 + 0.0 = 0.18085631758343632 .\n\nThe above areas add up to 2.2 texts.\nThen we will find the proposal with the largest area number.

For proposal two, the total volume is 10 ** 0.3 (for group ""A"") + 20 ** 0.3 (for group ""B"") + 30 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 2.154434690031884 * 2.7144176165949063 * 3.1072325059538586 = 18.2.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest volume area, the answer is (B) Proposal two.

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group A with 1 person in it, 
- group B with 1 person in it, and 
- group C with 1 person in it.

There are 2 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 10 for group A, 10 for group B, and 10 for group C.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 10 for group A, 20 for group B, and 30 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 1.0 * 1 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 1 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 1 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 = 3.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 1 (for group ""A"") + 11.0 * 1 (for group ""B"") + 21.0 * 1 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 + 11.0 + 21.0 = 33.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (B) Proposal two.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the (normalized) group size for each group.

For proposal one, the total volume is 50.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 7.0710678118654755 * 1.762734383267615 * 3.1072325059538586 = 38.7.

For proposal two, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.9193831036664843 * 1.0 = 1.9.

For proposal three, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.0 * 5.313292845913055 = 5.3.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

- proposal two: with an outcome of 10 for group A, 20 for group B, and 30 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 1.0 * 1 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 1 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 1 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 = 3.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 1 (for group ""A"") + 11.0 * 1 (for group ""B"") + 21.0 * 1 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 + 11.0 + 21.0 = 33.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (B) Proposal two.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 101.0 * (33 - 1) = 101.0 * 32 = 3212.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * (33 - 1) + 51.0 * 1 = 32.0 + 51.0 = 83.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * (33 - 1) + 51.0 * 1 + 51.0 * (33 - 1) = 32.0 + 51.0 + 51.0 = 134.0.

For proposal one, the total volume is 50.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 7.0710678118654755 * 1.762734383267615 * 3.1072325059538586 = 38.7.

For proposal two, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.9193831036664843 * 1.0 = 1.9.

For proposal three, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.0 * 5.313292845913055 = 5.3.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest volume area, the answer is (A) Proposal one.

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group A with 30 people in it, 
- group B with 10 people in it, and 
- group C with 20 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 50.0 for group A, 30.0 for group B, and 30.0 for group C.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 50.0 for group B, and 1.0 for group C.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 1.0 for group B, and 150.0 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 50.0 for group B, and 1.0 for group C.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 1.0 for group B, and 150.0 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the (normalized) group size for each group.

For proposal one, the total volume is 50.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 7.0710678118654755 * 1.762734383267615 * 3.1072325059538586 = 38.7.

For proposal two, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.9193831036664843 * 1.0 = 1.9.

For proposal three, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.0 * 5.313292845913055 = 5.3.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest volume area, the answer is (A) Proposal one.

- proposal one: with an outcome of 50.0 for group A, 30.0 for group B, and 30.0 for group C.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 50.0 for group B, and 1.0 for group C.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 1.0 for group B, and 150.0 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

In this qualification task, we will be using the following information and will measure the effectiveness of your proposal strategy. \n\nYou represent a brand who is interested in receiving the most favorable outcomes for several different requests on various groups.\n\nOn the first three requests, all three proposals gave you the same outcome on each corresponding group. The outcome is difficult to measure and will be referred to here as a Lightbulb. For these three requests your Lightbulb rating was 0. In this context the Lightbulb will fluctuate with different requests such that requests with more favorable outcomes for you can receive a higher or lower Lightbulb.\n\nIn the fourth request, 2 proposals out of the 3 proposals gave you something with a Lightbulb score of 1 for 1 of the 3 groups. When 0 or 1 proposals out of the 3 proposals give you the same Lightbulb score for 1 group or multiple groups respectively, a Lightbulb will carry over to the next request and can change the final outcome in the next request. The amount of Lightbulb transferred into the next request is referred to as a Renown in this instance.\n\nFor example, if a request has a Lightbulb rating of 2 and 1 proposal for that request with a Lightbulb rating of 1 changes the outcome to 3 Lightbulbs with the remaining 2 proposals not affecting the outcome of this request, the Lightbulb rating will be carried over to the next request and will be 2.

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

TASK: In this task we assess how well you can judge various aggregated properties of groups.

These charts will show you the numeric outcomes on a few proposals for a few groups.

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group apple-üçé with 33.0 people in it, 
- group bee-üêù with 33.0 people in it, and 
- group cow-üêÆ with 33.0 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 1.0 for group apple-üçé, 1.0 for group bee-üêù, and 1.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group apple-üçé, 101.0 for group bee-üêù, and 51.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 51.0 for group apple-üçé, 51.0 for group bee-üêù, and 101.0 for group cow-üêÆ.

TASK: A DumboSQL mission represents the entire procedure for finding the best results when asking for proposals on multiple groups. In this qualification task, we will be using the following information and will measure the effectiveness of your proposal strategy. 

You represent a brand who is interested in receiving the most favorable outcomes for several different requests on various groups.

On the first three requests, all three proposals gave you the same outcome on each corresponding group. The outcome is difficult to measure and will be referred to here as a Lightbulb. For these three requests your Lightbulb rating was 0. In this context the Lightbulb will fluctuate with different requests such that requests with more favorable outcomes for you can receive a higher or lower Lightbulb.

In the fourth request, 2 proposals out of the 3 proposals gave you something with a Lightbulb score of 1 for 1 of the 3 groups. When 0 or 1 proposals out of the 3 proposals give you the same Lightbulb score for 1 group or multiple groups respectively, a Lightbulb will carry over to the next request and can change the final outcome in the next request. The amount of Lightbulb transferred into the next request is referred to as a Renown in this instance.

For example, if a request has a Lightbulb rating of 2 and 1 proposal for that request with a Lightbulb rating of 1 changes the outcome to 3 Lightbulbs with the remaining 2 proposals not affecting the outcome of this request, the Lightbulb rating will be carried over to the next request and will be 2. On the next request, a Lightbulb of 2 is carried over, but 3 Lightbulbs will be required to win the request.

A DumboSQL mission has 4 requests. If a mission is incomplete prior to the 4th request, you will earn a Health score of 0.

Please use the following information to answer this question:
- If a mission is complete prior to the 4th request, your mission will be labeled incomplete.
- The mission is marked as incomplete if at least one of the 4 requests results in a Lightbulb rating of 0 for you.
- If you earn 4 lightbulbs, you have enough information to win the pending request. Any proposal with 1 or 2 Lightbulbs rating on the next request is still strategic for you.
- When you are able to, you can delegate and

For the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, here is the solution from our ground truth.\n- (C) proposal three with 1010.0 for group apple-üçé, 10.0 for group bee-üêù, and 1010.0 for group cow-üêÆ.\nFor the convenience of comparison, we designed this tool to approximate the total area. The result from the tool is 1023.0000000000004 in this case. Since the result from the tool is inconsistent with the ground truth answer (which is also unavailable to our tool) and the difference between the two is greater than 5 in absolute value, we can confirm that this recognized answer is incorrect. If you are confused, please give me a moment to fully explain the whole scenario.\n\nWe should process the proposal one as following. Based on your knowledge, proposal one included an outcome of 51.0 for group apple-üçé, 51.0 for group bee-üêù, and 51.0 for group cow-üêÆ.\n\nFor the total area of proposal one, we can calculate it via summing up the product of normalized group sizes and proposed outcomes. For each group, the normalized group size is the proposed outcome divided by the maximum possible outcome, and the proposed outcome is an aggregated one from all groups in this proposal.\n\nFor proposal one, we should group the outcome for each group as a tracked result, and then treat the tracked result for each group as group size. After that, we can sum up the product of tracked results for each group and group sizes for each group to get a consistent result.\n\nLet's take group apple-üçé for example. The normalized group size is the tracked result for group apple-üçé divided by the maximum possible tracked result in this proposal (which is also unavailable to our tool) After that, we can sum up the product of normalized group size for each group (i.e. the ratio) and the tracked result (i.e. the real outcome) for each group.\n\nWell, this measurement for individual group works well until here. Let's think about the shared result from this group. This is the result we should treat as group size. We can do it by dividing the total result of the group by the normalized group size. Since the normalized group size for this group is the tracked result divided by the maximum possible tracked result (again, we cannot get this maximum value from our tool),2"", ""\n\nAssistant: Let's think step by step.

- proposal one: with an outcome of 1.0 for group apple-üçé, 1.0 for group bee-üêù, and 101.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 101.0 for group apple-üçé, 51.0 for group bee-üêù, and 1.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group apple-üçé, 101.0 for group bee-üêù, and 51.0 for group cow-üêÆ.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For example, the total area for the proposal ""101.0 for group cow-üêÆ, 51.0 for group bee-üêù, 1.0 for group apple-üçé"" is 51.0 * 100 (for group bee-üêù) + 1.0 * 100 (for group apple-üçé) + 101.0 * 50 (for group cow-üêÆ) = 5100 + 100 + 5050 = 8050.

For proposition one, the total area is 51.0 * 100 (for group bee-üêù) + 1.0 * 100 (for group apple-üçé) + 101.0 * 20 (for group cow-üêÆ) = 5100 + 100 + 2020 = 7810.

For proposition two, the total area is 1.0 * 100 (for group bee-üêù) + 51.0 * 10 (for group apple-üçé) + 101.0 * 20 (for group cow-üêÆ) = 10 + 510 + 2020 = 2230.

For proposition three, the total area is 1.0 * 100 (for group bee-üêù) + 101.0 * 10 (for group apple-üçé) + 51.0 * 20 (for group cow-üêÆ) = 10 + 1010 + 1020 = 2130.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (B) Proposal two.

Human: In this scenario, there are 2 groups:
- group A with 10 people in it, and 
- group B with 10 people in it.

There is 1 proposal:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 20 for group A, and 10 for group B.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: 1. Area = ‚àë [ proposal ** normalized group size ]

Two types of value distribution for normalized group size can occur for projections.

This example uses a distribution that gives:
0% x 0.0% = 0.0
1-100% x 0.0% = 0.0

Assistant: For an area of 1.0, that would be salary distribution between groups A, B, and C.

We'll want to normalize by group size relative to group A. 33.0 / 100 = 0.33.

This means that once we scale the total area, we'll get the maximum else where for an area of 1.0, that would be salary distribution between groups A, B, and C.

Assistant: When the normalized group size is 1.0, which proposal has the smallest total area?
- (C) Proposal three

Note: Because the normalized group sizes are, in this example, integers, with a range of 0-100, the numeric values fall into the [0,1] range.

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group apple-üçé with 33.0 people in it, 
- group bee-üêù with 33.0 people in it, and 
- group cow-üêÆ with 33.0 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 51.0 for group apple-üçé, 1.0 for group bee-üêù, and 1.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group apple-üçé, 1.0 for group bee-üêù, and 1.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group apple-üçé, 101.0 for group bee-üêù, and 1.0 for group cow-üêÆ.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: 1.0 * 33.0 * 51.0 = 16960.0, as for proposal one.

1.0 * 33.0 * 1.0 = 33.0, as for proposal two.

1.0 * 33.0 * 101.0 = 3333.0, as for proposal three.

Then 16960.0 + 33.0 + 3333.0 = 20026.0 for proposal one.
31 + 33.0 + 1.0 = 65.0 for proposal two.
1.0 + 101.0 + 33.0 = 135.0 for proposal three.

Human: In the following chart, we will show you the numeric outcomes on a few proposals for a few groups. We will gradually introduce more proposals.

We will show you the outcome of all proposals on one group containing 40 people side by side, and you are asked to judge which proposal takes up the largest total volume, using the ""vs."" button.

Assign the proposed values to each group on the scale from ""ever wonderfulness"" to ""battlefield"" such that the proposed outcomes that sum up to the largest total volume appear on the same side of the scale then look at the ""battlefield side"" and describe in one or two words how you feel about the proposals for that particular group on the scale (make sure the proposed outcome is around 100 to 10 values):

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

These charts will show you the numeric outcomes on a few proposals for a few groups.

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group apple-üçé with 33.0 people in it, 
- group bee-üêù with 33.0 people in it, and 
- group cow-üêÆ with 33.0 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 51.0 for group apple-üçé, 1.0 for group bee-üêù, and 1.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group apple-üçé, 101.0 for group bee-üêù, and 101.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 51.0 for group apple-üçé, 51.0 for group bee-üêù, and 51.0 for group cow-üêÆ.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: 1.0 is singular, and 101.0 bugs. 2.0 <-> 30.0 for group bee-üêù... too big, 51.0 <-> 33.0 too small, 100.0 <-> 66.0 ok, 101.0 <-> 67.0... too close.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

For proposal two, the total area is
- 51 * 33.0 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 1 * 33.0 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 51 * 33.0 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 50.0 + 33.0 + 50.0 = 133.0.
- 51 * 33.0 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 1 * 33.0 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 51 * 33.0 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 50.0 + 33.0 + 50.0 = 133.0.

For proposal three, the total area is
- 1 * 33.0 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 51 * 33.0 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 1 * 33.0 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 33.0 + 1663.0 + 33.0 = 1699.0.
- 1 * 33.0 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 51 * 33.0 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 1 * 33.0 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 33.0 + 1663.0 + 33.0 = 169

For proposal two, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.9193831036664843 * 1.0 = 1.9.

For proposal three, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.0 * 5.313292845913055 = 5.3.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest volume area, the answer is (A) Proposal one.

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group A with 30 people in it, 
- group B with 10 people in it, and 
- group C with 20 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 50.0 for group A, 30.0 for group B, and 30.0 for group C.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 50.0 for group B, and 1.0 for group C.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 1.0 for group B, and 150.0 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

These charts will show you the numeric outcomes on a few proposals for a few groups.

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group apple-üçé with 33.0 people in it, 
- group bee-üêù with 33.0 people in it, and 
- group cow-üêÆ with 33.0 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 1.0 for group apple-üçé, 1.0 for group bee-üêù, and 1.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 51.0 for group apple-üçé, 51.0 for group bee-üêù, and 51.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group apple-üçé, 1.0 for group bee-üêù, and 1.0 for group cow-üêÆ.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: 1.0 * 33 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 1.0 * 33 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 1.0 * 33 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 99.0 for proposal one.

51.0 * 33 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 51.0 * 33 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 51.0 * 33 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 1683.0 for proposal two.

1.0 * 33 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 1.0 * 33 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 1.0 * 33 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 99.0 for proposal three.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

Know that this is a different definition of area than said before in this evaluation. We mostly measure the volume of a group(prop) (which is groups(The number of people in each group)^2 * (To this you add the outcome of Prop)^2).\n\nWhatever the outcome was, a 1 is added. This is then normalized to divide by the sum of Prop 1, Prop 2, and Prop 3 and then cut it in half so that every group has 50%. Then the number is multiplied by the original outcome of proposal 1 for that group.\n\nThus the outcome for Proposal 3 is:\n(1 * 33.0 * 33.0 * 1) + 51.0 * 1.0\n-----------------------------------------------------\nProp 1  +  Prop 2 +  Prop 3\n\nThen we turn that into a percentage so that we are always getting a value > 0 (and < = 1).\n(0.5370741547274868 + 0.7652895301030093)\n-----------------------------------------------\nProp 1  +  Prop 2 +  Prop 3\n\nArriving at:\n214.69196347674704 / (73.0 * 3.0),\nan incredibly high number for Proposal 3.\n\nArea: 3.54973610722751233', ""\n\nAssistant: Let's think step by step.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

- proposal two: with an outcome of 101.0 for group apple-üçé, 51.0 for group bee-üêù, and 1.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group apple-üçé, 51.0 for group bee-üêù, and 51.0 for group cow-üêÆ.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: 1. Let's look at proposal three. Let's formalize how we compute the area of a proposal, where an outcome of a proposal is normalized to a total of 1.0 for each group using the following formula:

> Proposal area = [Outcome of proposal for group A * group A size] + [Outcome of proposal for group B * group B size] + [Outcome of proposal for group C * group C size]

Based on the above formula, the result is:

> Proposal area for proposal three = [ 1 * 1] + [ 51 * 1] + [ 51 * 1]

By adding up the results, we have:

> Proposal area for proposal three = [ (1 + 51 + 51) * 1 ]

We now solve:

> Proposal area for proposal three = [103 * 1]

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

""Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?"" is talking about the area of the proposal part, adding up the parts with the corresponding bidirections (peer-to-peer) or projected bidirections (peer-to-supervisor). Since Apple is completely contained in every proposal part, there is no difference between the algorithm performance with and without noting the contained projections.

The price of a lottery ticket is $1 (status quo). After buying, they will come back to pick up their winning prizes, with another lottery ticket with reverse priority. To show their tickets, they will go to the second (middle) terminal of the white boxes. The price of a lottery ticket depends on its priority.

For proposal two, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.9193831036664843 * 1.0 = 1.9.

For proposal three, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.0 * 5.313292845913055 = 5.3.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest volume area, the answer is (A) Proposal one.

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group A with 30 people in it, 
- group B with 10 people in it, and 
- group C with 20 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 50.0 for group A, 30.0 for group B, and 30.0 for group C.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 50.0 for group B, and 1.0 for group C.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 1.0 for group B, and 150.0 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

For proposal two, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.9193831036664843 * 1.0 = 1.9.

For proposal three, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.0 * 5.313292845913055 = 5.3.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest volume area, the answer is (A) Proposal one.

- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 50.0 for group B, and 1.0 for group C.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 1.0 for group B, and 150.0 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

This task level doesn't just assess how well you characterize the total areas of the proposed outcomes.

Therefore the correct answer is (C) Proposal three.\n\n\nTASK: Can you summarize your answer to the previous question covering aggregated proposal property by writing only the proposal letter?3', '\n\nAssistant: 33.0 * 1.0 * 33.0 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 33.0 * 1.0 * 33.0 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 33.0 * 1.0 * 33.0 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") is 1092 to 1131.\n- the larger area from proposal three.\n- (C) Proposal three3', '\n\nAssistant: From the material, you know that the total group area for a proposal is calculated like a linear area, that is, each group\'s area is simply multiplied by the proposed outcome. Let\'s calculate the total group area for proposal one based on the given information. For proposal one, the total group area is 1.0 * 33 + 1 * 33 + 1.0 * 33 = 100.0.\n\nImagine now merging together all the groups. This would result in a single group made of the entire population. The overall outcome of the new merged group would be 100.0, and the area of the merged group would be 33 * 33, that is, about 1081. Actually, 1081 is very close to 1000 (1.0 * Numbers of People in the Most-populous Group ^ 2) since it is a multiple of three (Numbers of Groups). Remember that this is not the area of the group. It is, in fact, the area of the square region that contains all group members in it, regardless of their affiliations.\n\nYou will soon understand a major premise underlying this subtle calculation.\n\nThinking more intuitively, you realize that there are two main criteria while considering which group has the largest area. The first one is the number of members in the group. That means that if we consider that each group of three people take up one unit of area, the greatest group area would probably be 99 for a group made of 66 people, not 100 for a group made of 33 people. Such a conclusion is, however, too simplistic. Groups like those made up of three people or seven people may have an intermediate or marginal influence on group outcomes. These groups may be sidelined because they are ""too small"", or ""a few too many"".\n\nThe second criterion is whether or not each group has significantly different size. You can observe that this is the case for both groups apple-üçé and bee-üêù. Group apple-üçé consists of 33 little squarish Germans, while group bee-üêù consists of 33 fairly large Italians. Each apple-üçé member is worth only about one-third of the worth of a group bee-üêù member.

Human: In this scenario, there are 2 groups:
- group A with 10 people in it, and 
- group B with 10 people in it.

There is 1 proposal:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 20 for group A, and 10 for group B.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one

Compare proposals 1.0 and 101.0: Proposal 1.0 (51.0 for Group Apple, 1.0 for Group Bee and 51.0 for Group Cow) is closer to Proposal 101.0, which is more closely related to Proposal 1.0 in chart 5, than to Proposal 2 (1.0 for Group Apple, 1.0 for Group Bee and 51.0 for Group Cow). And, on the other hand, Proposal 101.0 is closer to Proposal 2 (1.0 for Group Apple, 1.0 for Group Bee and 51.0 for Group Cow) than to Proposal 1.0 (51.0 for Group Apple, 1.0 for Group Bee and 51.0 for Group Cow).\n\nTherefore, the answer to the above task is (B) Proposal two.2""]","

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

Human: Summarize your answer to the question above by writing only the proposal letter.

Assistant: C

Human: This is a qualification task. Your answers will be compared to our ground truth answers.

TASK: In this task we assess how well you can judge various aggregated properties of groups.

These charts will show you the numeric outcomes on a few proposals for a few groups.

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group apple-üçé with 33.0 people in it, 
- group bee-üêù with 33.0 people in it, and 
- group cow-üêÆ with 33.0 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 51.0 for group apple-üçé, 1.0 for group bee-üêù, and 51.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group apple-üçé, 1.0 for group bee-üêù, and 51.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 101.0 for group apple-üçé, 101.0 for group bee-üêù, and 1.0 for group cow-üêÆ.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Take your time. Open the following links to study the charts.

Let's think step by step. The results seen in each chart measure relative positions between two proposals (e.g., total volume, total area, etc.). Chart 1 evaluates the relative position between group Apple (üçé) vs. group Bee (üêù). Note that in order to show you the relative position, in Chart 1 the outcome of 1.0 added to the volumes from Groups Beeüêù and Appleüçé is set to be zero.

- Show Chart 1: Group Apple (üçé) vs. Group Bee (üêù)
- Show Chart 2: Group Apple (üçé) vs. Group Bee (üêù)
- Show Chart 3: Group Apple (üçé) vs. Group Bee (üêù)
- Show Chart 4: Group Apple (üçé) vs. Group Bee (üêù)
- Show Chart 5: Group Apple (üçé) vs. Group Bee (üêù)

For each proposal, the shape of group Apple (üçé) is computed relative to the shapes of the two groups Appleüçé and Beeüêù. Compare proposals 1.0 and 101.0: Proposal 1.0 (51.0 for Group Apple, 1.0 for Group Bee and 51.0 for Group Cow) is closer to Proposal 101.0, which is more closely related to Proposal 1.0 in chart 5, than to Proposal 2 (1.0 for Group Apple, 1.0 for Group Bee and 51.0 for Group Cow). And, on the other hand, Proposal 101.0 is closer to Proposal 2 (1.0 for Group Apple, 1.0 for Group Bee and 51.0 for Group Cow) than to Proposal 1.0 (51.0 for Group Apple, 1.0 for Group Bee and 51.0 for Group Cow).

Therefore, the answer to the above task is (B) Proposal two.

- proposal one: with an outcome of 50.0 for group A, 30.0 for group B, and 30.0 for group C.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 50.0 for group B, and 1.0 for group C.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 1.0 for group B, and 150.0 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group apple-üçé, 51.0 for group bee-üêù, and 51.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group apple-üçé, 1.0 for group bee-üêù, and 101.0 for group cow-üêÆ.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: 1. To answer this correctly, you need to understand that the answer depends on how aggregated the data is.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

TASK: In this task we assess how well you can judge various aggregated properties of groups.

These charts will show you the numeric outcomes on a few proposals for a few groups.

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group apple-üçé with 33.0 people in it, 
- group bee-üêù with 33.0 people in it, and 
- group cow-üêÆ with 33.0 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 51.0 for group apple-üçé, 1.0 for group bee-üêù, and 1.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group apple-üçé, 101.0 for group bee-üêù, and 101.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 51.0 for group apple-üçé, 51.0 for group bee-üêù, and 51.0 for group cow-üêÆ.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 0.0 * 101 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 0.0 * 202 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 0.0 * 202 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 0.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 3.0 * 1 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 33.0 * 202 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 39.0 * 202 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 3.0 + 6628.0 + 7868.0 = 14899.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 0.0 * 101 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 0.0 * 33 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 33.0 * 181 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 0.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (B) Proposal two.

The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group. Based on that formula, a group size of 33.0 multiplies an outcome of 1.0 make the final total area be about 33.0. Also, a group size of 33.0 multiplies an outcome of 101.0 make the final total area be about 3312.7. Lastly, a group size of 33.0 multiplies an outcome of 51.0 make the final total area be about 1650.0. If we compare these three values, we can see that the largest total area is associated with the proposal 2. Therefore, answer (B) Proposal two.\n\n2. Human: OK, that's correct!

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group A with 30 people in it, 
- group B with 10 people in it, and 
- group C with 20 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 50.0 for group A, 30.0 for group B, and 30.0 for group C.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 50.0 for group B, and 1.0 for group C.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 1.0 for group B, and 150.0 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

For proposal one, the total volume is 50.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 7.0710678118654755 * 1.762734383267615 * 3.1072325059538586 = 38.7.

For proposal two, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.9193831036664843 * 1.0 = 1.9.

For proposal three, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.0 * 5.313292845913055 = 5.3.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest volume area, the answer is (A) Proposal one.

- proposal one: with an outcome of 50.0 for group A, 30.0 for group B, and 30.0 for group C.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 50.0 for group B, and 1.0 for group C.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 1.0 for group B, and 150.0 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

Assistant: A

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group A with 30 people in it, 
- group B with 10 people in it, and 
- group C with 20 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 50.0 for group A, 30.0 for group B, and 30.0 for group C.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 50.0 for group B, and 1.0 for group C.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 1.0 for group B, and 150.0 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

TASK: In this task we assess how well you can judge various aggregated properties of groups.

These charts will show you the numeric outcomes on a few proposals for a few groups.

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group apple-üçé with 33.0 people in it, 
- group bee-üêù with 33.0 people in it, and 
- group cow-üêÆ with 33.0 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 1.0 for group apple-üçé, 1.0 for group bee-üêù, and 1.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 51.0 for group apple-üçé, 1.0 for group bee-üêù, and 1.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 51.0 for group apple-üçé, 1.0 for group bee-üêù, and 1.0 for group cow-üêÆ.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step.
We start by calculating the total area for each proposal. The total area for proposal ""1"" is 1.0 * 33 for group ""apple-üçé"" + 1.0 * 33 for group ""bee-üêù"" + 1.0 * 33 for group ""cow-üêÆ"" = 99.0.

For proposal ""2"", the total area is 51.0 * 33 for group ""apple-üçé"" + 1.0 * 33 for group ""bee-üêù"" + 1.0 * 33 for group ""cow-üêÆ"" = 2033.0.

For proposal ""3"", the total area is 51.0 * 33 for group ""apple-üçé"" + 1.0 * 33 for group ""bee-üêù"" + 1.0 * 33 for group ""cow-üêÆ"" = 2033.0.
Therefore, the largest total area is ""3"".

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group A with 30 people in it, 
- group B with 10 people in it, and 
- group C with 20 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 50.0 for group A, 30.0 for group B, and 30.0 for group C.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 50.0 for group B, and 1.0 for group C.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 1.0 for group B, and 150.0 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

Human: This is a qualification task. Your answers will be compared to our ground truth answers.

TASK: In this task we assess how well you can judge various aggregated properties of groups.

These charts will show you the numeric outcomes on a few proposals for a few groups.

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group apple-üçé with 33.0 people in it, 
- group bee-üêù with 33.0 people in it, and 
- group cow-üêÆ with 33.0 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 51.0 for group apple-üçé, 51.0 for group bee-üêù, and 51.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 101.0 for group apple-üçé, 51.0 for group bee-üêù, and 101.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group apple-üçé, 1.0 for group bee-üêù, and 1.0 for group cow-üêÆ.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. Since all three proposals are equally weighted for one group Apple-üçé, Apple-üçé does not have any relation with the judgment question.

So, we need to compare the two proposals given on the opposite size for two groups Bee-üêù and Cow-üêÆ only.
Proposal one: with an outcome of 51.0 for group apple-üçé, 51.0 for group bee-üêù, and 51.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
Proposal two: with an outcome of 101.0 for group apple-üçé, 51.0 for group bee-üêù, and 101.0 for group cow-üêÆ.

For proposal one, the total area is 21.0 * 33 (for group ""Bee-üêù"") + 21.0 * 33 (for group ""Cow-üêÆ"") = 693.0 + 693.0 = 1386.0.
For proposal two, the total area is 41.0 * 33 (for group ""Bee-üêù"") + 41.0 * 33 (for group ""Cow-üêÆ"") = 1363.0 + 1363.0 = 2726.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (B) Proposal two.

scenario section, where the ingredients for all that happened are gathered for consideration.
However, the taste of the scenario is presented in the form of a graph.

Then, the system allows the human to enter their own propositions and findings that describe the contents
of the graph. For example, bear-üêª might be carrying around a large fish or maybe there's a weather event
that caused bears-üêª to gather at the pond in the big lake-üèû.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: 1. Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group. For proposal one, the total area is 33.0 * 101.0 + 33.0 * 101.0 + 33.0 * 1.0 = 3363.0 + 3363.0 + 33.0 = 6699.0. For proposal two, the total area is 33.0 * 51.0 + 33.0 * 51.0 + 33.0 * 51.0 = 1683.0 + 1683.0 + 1683.0 = 5059.0. For proposal three, the total area is 33.0 * 1.0 + 33.0 * 1.0 + 33.0 * 1.0 = 33.0 + 33.0 + 33.0 = 99.0. Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three. Summarize your answer to the question above by writing only the proposal letter.

Clearly, multiple properties are more specific and more accurate in aggregation than one property (e.g., a group treating all proposals the same by giving the total area of a proposal as 1 results in aggregating all proposals of the same total value). In many scenarios, two properties may have the same desired property and have the same ranking on the desired property (e.g., proposal 1 and proposal 2 may expectedly share the same ranking or non-ranked on taking up the largest total area), while there may be other scenarios where no such agreement exists.\n\nFor 1. and 3., a group can input both ""1"" and 3."" to reflect that both of the proposals take up the same largest area in different situations.1', ""\n\nAssistant: Let's think step by step.

Assistant: 1. Seems to be correct. So let's try the evaluator.

Evaluator: Your judgment: C

Evaluator: Let's look at the charts of the proposals.

1. There are 3 trees this time. Each tree represents one proposal. The area under the top of the tree is called the ""abscissa"". The area under the bottom of the tree is called the ""ordinate"". The top and bottom of each tree is colored inverse of the outcome of the proposal. Any part of the rectangle above the ""abscissa"", is colored green, and the part below is colored red. Finally, any height on the ""bottom"" of the rectangle is called the height, and the total area under the rectangle is called the volume

Under each tree, there is a ""group bar"" chart. This chart shows the distribution of the outcomes on the proposal for a single group. For now let's just say that the ""height"" (profit) for the group bee-üêù is 1, and the ""height"" (profit) for the group cow-üêÆ is 51.

Summary: For proposal 1, the area of the main rectangle is: 4.840185088063024 and the area of the first tree is 3.2480104732777086, and the area of the second tree is 1.5921746147853153. For proposal 2, the area of the main rectangle is 7.099152110423002 and the area of the first tree is 3.527259536256215 and the area of the second tree is 3.571892573166787. For proposal 3, the area of the main rectangle is 1.257899866390316 and the area of the first tree is 1.257899866390316 and the area of the second tree is not applicable.

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 33.0 * 51.0 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 33.0 * 51.0 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 33.0 * 51.0 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 1719.0 + 1663.0 + 1683.0 = 5065.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 51.0 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 101.0 * 33.0 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 1.0 * 33.0 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 51.0 + 3343.0 + 33.0 = 3397.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 101.0 * 33.0 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 1.0 * 33.0 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 101.0 * 33.0 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 3333.0 + 33.0 + 3333.0 = 6669.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group A with 1 person in it, 
- group B with 1 person in it, and 
- group C with 1 person in it.

There are 2 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 10 for group A, 10 for group B, and 10 for group C.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 10 for group A, 10 for group B, and 10 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 1.0 * 1 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 1 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 1 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 = 3.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 1 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 1 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 1 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 = 3.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (A) Proposal one.

There are 2 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 10 for group A, 10 for group B, and 10 for group C.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 10 for group A, 20 for group B, and 30 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the (normalized) group size for each group.

For proposal one, the total volume is 10 ** 0.3 (for group ""A"") + 10 ** 0.3 (for group ""B"") + 10 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 2.154434690031884 * 2.154434690031884 * 2.154434690031884 = 10.0.

For proposal two, the total volume is 10 ** 0.3 (for group ""A"") + 20 ** 0.3 (for group ""B"") + 30 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 2.154434690031884 * 2.7144176165949063 * 3.1072325059538586 = 18.2.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the (normalized) group size for each group.

For proposal one, the total volume is 50.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 7.0710678118654755 * 1.762734383267615 * 3.1072325059538586 = 38.7.

For proposal two, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.9193831036664843 * 1.0 = 1.9.

For proposal three, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.0 * 5.313292845913055 = 5.3.

- group C with 1 person in it.

There are 2 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 10 for group A, 10 for group B, and 10 for group C.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 10 for group A, 20 for group B, and 30 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the (normalized) group size for each group.

For proposal one, the total volume is 10 ** 0.3 (for group ""A"") + 10 ** 0.3 (for group ""B"") + 10 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 2.154434690031884 * 2.154434690031884 * 2.154434690031884 = 10.0.

For proposal two, the total volume is 10 ** 0.3 (for group ""A"") + 20 ** 0.3 (for group ""B"") + 30 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 2.154434690031884 * 2.7144176165949063 * 3.1072325059538586 = 18.2.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest volume area, the answer is (B) Proposal two.

There are 2 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 10 for group A, 10 for group B, and 10 for group C.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 10 for group A, 20 for group B, and 30 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 1.0 * 1 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 1 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 1 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 = 3.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 1 (for group ""A"") + 11.0 * 1 (for group ""B"") + 21.0 * 1 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 + 11.0 + 21.0 = 33.0.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the (normalized) group size for each group.

For proposal one, the total volume is 50.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 7.0710678118654755 * 1.762734383267615 * 3.1072325059538586 = 38.7.

For proposal two, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.9193831036664843 * 1.0 = 1.9.

For proposal three, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.0 * 5.313292845913055 = 5.3.

- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 1.0 for group B, and 150.0 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the (normalized) group size for each group.

For proposal one, the total volume is 50.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 7.0710678118654755 * 1.762734383267615 * 3.1072325059538586 = 38.7.

For proposal two, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.9193831036664843 * 1.0 = 1.9.

For proposal three, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.0 * 5.313292845913055 = 5.3.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest volume area, the answer is (A) Proposal one.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 50.0 for group A, 30.0 for group B, and 30.0 for group C.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 50.0 for group B, and 1.0 for group C.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 1.0 for group B, and 150.0 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

For proposal one, the total area is 1.0 * 1 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 1 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 1 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 = 3.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 1 (for group ""A"") + 11.0 * 1 (for group ""B"") + 21.0 * 1 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 + 11.0 + 21.0 = 33.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (B) Proposal two.

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group A with 30 people in it, 
- group B with 10 people in it, and 
- group C with 20 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 50.0 for group A, 30.0 for group B, and 30.0 for group C.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 50.0 for group B, and 1.0 for group C.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 1.0 for group B, and 150.0 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the (normalized) group size for each group.

For proposal one, the total volume is 50.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 7.0710678118654755 * 1.762734383267615 * 3.1072325059538586 = 38.7.

For proposal two, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.9193831036664843 * 1.0 = 1.9.

For proposal three, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.0 * 5.313292845913055 = 5.3.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest volume area, the answer is (A) Proposal one.

- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

- proposal one: with an outcome of 50.0 for group A, 30.0 for group B, and 30.0 for group C.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 50.0 for group B, and 1.0 for group C.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 1.0 for group B, and 150.0 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total volume?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total volume for a proposal is calculated by multiplying the proposed outcome raised to the (normalized) group size for each group.

For proposal one, the total volume is 50.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 7.0710678118654755 * 1.762734383267615 * 3.1072325059538586 = 38.7.

For proposal two, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.9193831036664843 * 1.0 = 1.9.

For proposal three, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.0 * 5.313292845913055 = 5.3.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest volume area, the answer is (A) Proposal one.

- proposal one: with an outcome of 50.0 for group A, 30.0 for group B, and 30.0 for group C.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 50.0 for group B, and 1.0 for group C.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 1.0 for group B, and 150.0 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

For proposal one, the total volume is 50.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 7.0710678118654755 * 1.762734383267615 * 3.1072325059538586 = 38.7.

For proposal two, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.9193831036664843 * 1.0 = 1.9.

For proposal three, the total volume is 1.0 ** 0.5 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 ** 0.2 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 ** 0.3 (for group ""C"") = 1.0 * 1.0 * 5.313292845913055 = 5.3.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest volume area, the answer is (A) Proposal one.

Human: Summarize your answer to the question above by writing only the proposal letter.

Assistant: A

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group A with 30 people in it, 
- group B with 10 people in it, and 
- group C with 20 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 50.0 for group A, 30.0 for group B, and 30.0 for group C.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 50.0 for group B, and 1.0 for group C.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group A, 1.0 for group B, and 150.0 for group C.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: Let's think step by step. The total area for a proposal is calculated by summing up the product of group size and proposed outcome for each group.

For proposal one, the total area is 50.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 30.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 30.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 1500.0 + 300.0 + 600.0 = 2400.0.

For proposal two, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 50.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 1.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 500.0 + 20.0 = 550.0.

For proposal three, the total area is 1.0 * 30 (for group ""A"") + 1.0 * 10 (for group ""B"") + 150.0 * 20 (for group ""C"") = 30.0 + 10.0 + 3000.0 = 3040.0.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (C) Proposal three.

Human: Summarize your answer to the question above by writing only the proposal letter.

Assistant: C

Human: This is a qualification task. Your answers will be compared to our ground truth answers.

TASK: In this task we assess how well you can judge various aggregated properties of groups.

These charts will show you the numeric outcomes on a few proposals for a few groups.

Human: In this scenario, there are 3 groups:
- group apple-üçé with 33.0 people in it, 
- group bee-üêù with 33.0 people in it, and 
- group cow-üêÆ with 33.0 people in it.

There are 3 proposals:
- proposal one: with an outcome of 1.0 for group apple-üçé, 1.0 for group bee-üêù, and 51.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal two: with an outcome of 1.0 for group apple-üçé, 101.0 for group bee-üêù, and 1.0 for group cow-üêÆ.
- proposal three: with an outcome of 1.0 for group apple-üçé, 51.0 for group bee-üêù, and 51.0 for group cow-üêÆ.

Which of the proposal(s) takes up the largest total area?
- (A) Proposal one
- (B) Proposal two
- (C) Proposal three

Assistant: 1.0 * 33.0 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + 1.0 * 33.0 (for group ""bee-üêù"") + 51.0 * 33.0 (for group ""cow-üêÆ"") = 35.91631508364888 + 35.91631508364888 + 1.675960139707225 = 73.50859030209676.

Therefore, for the question of which proposal takes up the largest total area, the answer is (A) Proposal one.

Human: Summarize your answer to the question above by writing only the proposal letter.

Assistant: 1.0 * 33.0 (for group ""apple-üçé"") + "
