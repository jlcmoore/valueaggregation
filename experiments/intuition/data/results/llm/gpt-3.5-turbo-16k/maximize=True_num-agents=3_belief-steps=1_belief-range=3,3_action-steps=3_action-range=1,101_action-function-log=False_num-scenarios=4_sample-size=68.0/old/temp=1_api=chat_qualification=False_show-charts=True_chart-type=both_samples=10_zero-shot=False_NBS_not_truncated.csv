Based on the information provided, it seems like Proposal two has a lower total volume but a higher total area compared to the other proposals. Since higher outcomes are considered better, Proposal three has the highest total area, indicating larger benefits across the groups.\n\nTherefore, the best compromise in this situation would be:\n- (C) Proposal three\nC', 'Based on the given information, we have assessed the total volume and total area for each proposal.
