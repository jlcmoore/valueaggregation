This decision is based on the analysis of the total volume and total area of each proposal. While Proposal one has the highest total area, indicating a potentially better outcome for the individual groups, Proposal two presents a more balanced compromise solution. It offers a moderate reduction in the average cost of medical visits for all groups, resulting in a reasonable total volume and a more equitable distribution of benefits.
