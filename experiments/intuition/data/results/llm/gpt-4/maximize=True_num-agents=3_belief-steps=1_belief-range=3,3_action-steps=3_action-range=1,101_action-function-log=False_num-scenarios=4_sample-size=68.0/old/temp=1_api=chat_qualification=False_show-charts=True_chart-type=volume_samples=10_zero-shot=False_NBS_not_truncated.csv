Since both proposals two and three increase the benefits of two groups quite significantly, I will choose the one that causes the least disparity between the most and the least benefitted groups. \n\nProposal two has an improvement of 101 days for group ""apple-üçé"" and 1 day for group ""cow-üêÆ"" - a difference of 100 days. \n\nWhile proposal three has a difference of 100 days as well between group ""bee-üêù"" and ""apple-üçé"", the group ""cow-üêÆ"" that was the most benefitted in proposal one is still quite significantly benefitted in proposal three with a reduction of 51 days in waiting time, as compared to just 1 day for group ""cow-üêÆ"" in proposal two. \n\nTherefore, considering that all three groups get a significant outcome improvement across proposals one to three, proposal three (C) seems to spread the benefits more evenly across all groups when taking the three proposals collectively into consideration. \n\nHence, my answer is (C) Proposal three.\nC', '(B) Proposal two\nB', '(B) Proposal two\nB', '(B) Proposal two\nB', '(B) Proposal two\nB', '(B) Proposal two\nB', '(B) Proposal two\nB', '(B) Proposal two\nB', '(B) Proposal two\nB', '(B) Proposal two\nB']","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'Follow the given examples and answer the questions.
