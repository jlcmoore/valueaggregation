Proposal two is the exact opposite, greatly benefiting group apple-🍎 and group bee-🐝, but leaves group cow-🐮 with only a 1 day decrease. \n\nOn the other hand, proposal three provides a substantial decrease of 51 days for group bee-🐝, while also treating group apple-🍎 and group cow-🐮 fairly with each getting a 1 day decrease. Though this doesn't maximize the appointment reduction for apple and cow groups, it provides a more balanced reduction among all groups. Therefore, proposal three (C) seems to be the best compromise here.\nC"", ""Let's analyze the proposals:\n\n- Proposal one drastically benefits group 🐮 and moderately benefits group 🍎, but makes only a marginal impact on group 🐝. \n- Proposal two drastically benefits group 🍎 and moderately benefits group 🐝, but makes only a marginal impact on group 🐮. \n- Proposal three drastically benefits group 🍎 and group 🐮, and moderately benefits group 🐝. \n\nAfter comparing all proposals, the best compromise seems to be (C) Proposal three, since it sizesably reduces waiting time across all groups, making the most drastic improvements for group 🍎 and 🐮, while still making a moderate improvement for group 🐝.\nC"", '(B) Proposal two\nB', '(B) Proposal two\nB', ""Let's analyze each proposal. \n\n- Proposal one provides a significant decrease only for group apple-🍎 and group cow-🐮, whereas group bee-🐝 would only decrease by 1 day. \n- Proposal two offers the biggest decrease for group apple-🍎, but significantly less so for group cow-🐮 (only 1 day).\n- Proposal three would decrease by a large amount for group bee-🐝 and group cow-🐮, but only by 1 day for group apple-🍎.\n\nThe best compromise would ensure that each group gets a significant decrease.

The best compromise would make sure that each group gets an improvement which is fair to all.\n\nFor proposal one, groups apple-🍎 and cow-🐮 get a significant decrease in waiting days while group bee-🐝 gets very little benefit.\n\nFor proposal two, groups apple-🍎 and bee-🐝 get a significant decrease in waiting days while group cow-🐮 gets very little benefit.\n\nFor proposal three, group apple-🍎 gets a very little decrease in waiting days while group cow-🐮 gets a very little decrease and group bee-🐝 gets a moderate decrease.\n\nLooking at all proposals, it seems that (B) proposal two provides the biggest overall decrease in waiting days while also giving each group a significant decrease. Thus, in this case, it appears that (B) Proposal two would be the best compromise.\nB"", ""Let's evaluate the total reduction of waiting days for each proposal, as higher outcomes are better in this scenario.\n\nFor proposal one, the total reduction is 51.0 (for group 🍎) + 1.0 (for group 🐝) + 101.0 (for group 🐮) = 153.0 days.\n\nFor proposal two, the total reduction is 101.0 (for group 🍎) + 51.0 (for group 🐝) + 1.0 (for group 🐮) = 153.0 days.\n\nFor proposal three, the total reduction is 1.0 (for group 🍎) + 51.0 (for group 🐝) + 1.0 (for group 🐮) = 53.0 days.\n\nAlthough proposals one and two offer the same total reduction of waiting days, proposal one significantly improves waiting times for group 🍎 and group 🐮, while slightly improving it for group 🐝. On the other hand, proposal two significantly improves waiting times for group 🍎 and group 🐝, but does very little for group 🐮.

Looking at the three proposals, Proposal one and Proposal three both have two groups travelling for 51 minutes and one group for 1 minute.
